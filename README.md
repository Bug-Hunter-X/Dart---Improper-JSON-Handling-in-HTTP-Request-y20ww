# Dart: Improper JSON Handling in HTTP Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart applications when handling JSON responses from HTTP requests.  The original code lacks robust error handling, which can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior if the JSON response is malformed or missing expected data.

The `bug.dart` file contains the code with the error. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling. 

**Key improvements in the solution:**

* **Explicit JSON Decoding Error Handling:** The solution includes a `try-catch` block around `jsonDecode` to handle potential `FormatException` errors if the JSON response is invalid.
* **Null Safety:** It explicitly checks for null values before accessing them to avoid `NullPointerException` exceptions.
* **Comprehensive Error Handling:** More informative error messages are provided to the user or for logging purposes.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling when working with external data sources in Dart.
